# 100 days of ML  

Rules:  
• Mix of theory and practical projects  
• Apply all new theoretical concepts practically (simple scripts/notebooks).
• Repetition sessions.
• Strong attention to fundamentals. Don't go too fast, pay attention to details.  
• Don't burn out

What I plan to do during these 100 days (things will be added/removed as I go):  

---
## Python:  
• **Learn Python the Hard Way**, Zed A. Shaw  
• **Learn More Python 3 the Hard Way**, Zed A. Shaw  
• **Coffee Break Python**, Christian Mayer  
• **Python Notes for Professionals**, https://books.goalkicker.com/PythonBook/  
• Data mining (beautiful soup) - practice getting ugly data, and all the steps until it can be passed to PyTorch   
• Flask  
• Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib  

## Algorithms and Data Structures:  
• **Algorithms: Notes for Professionals**,  https://books.goalkicker.com/AlgorithmsBook/  

## ML/DL  
• [mlcourse.ai](https://www.mlcourse.ai)  
• Finish **Intro to DL with PyTorch** from Udacity  
• **Deep Learning with Python**, Francois Chollet  

## Math/Statistics
• Linear algebra/calculus, not sure about resources yet   

## Practical project ideas:  
• Hygeia  
• World Pollution Database?  
• Hnefatafl game?  
• and a ton of smaller projects/Jupyter notebooks
