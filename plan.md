# 100 days of ML  
<a href="100days.md">plan.md</a>  

Rules:  
* Mix of theory and practical projects  
* Apply all new theoretical concepts practically (simple scripts/notebooks).
* Repetition sessions.
* Strong attention to fundamentals. Don't go too fast, pay attention to details.  
* Don't burn out

What I plan to do during these 100 days (things will be added/removed as I go):  

---
## Python:  
* **Learn Python the Hard Way**, Zed A. Shaw  
* **Learn More Python 3 the Hard Way**, Zed A. Shaw  
* **Coffee Break Python**, Christian Mayer  
* **Python Notes for Professionals**, https://books.goalkicker.com/PythonBook/  
* [Intermediate Python book](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/)
* Data mining (beautiful soup) - practice getting ugly data, and all the steps until it can be passed to PyTorch   
* Flask  
* Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib (seaborn)
* Do exercises on Hackerrank or some similar platform (pick one)
* Pick one Editor/IDE for Python and become good at it (VS code? Or one of PyCharm/Atom/Sublime Text)
* A bit of DevOps as well...
* Kivy
* [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
* [yapf python formatter](https://github.com/google/yapf/)
* Testing - pick nose2 or pytest (read about Python doc tests), and use in personal projects
* Read more source code, learn, examine
* get used to terminal/commandline help commands for python and different libraries

## Algorithms and Data Structures:  
* **Algorithms: Notes for Professionals**,  https://books.goalkicker.com/AlgorithmsBook/  

## ML/DL  
* [mlcourse.ai](https://www.mlcourse.ai)  
* Finish **Intro to DL with PyTorch** from Udacity  
* **Deep Learning with Python**, Francois Chollet  
* Coursera DL specialization (5 courses):  
  * Neural Networks and Deep Learning  
  * Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization  
  * Structuring Machine Learning Projects  
  * Convolutional Neural Networks  
  * Sequence Models  

## Math/Statistics
* Linear algebra/calculus, not sure about resources yet   

## Practical project ideas:  
* Hygeia  
* World Pollution Database?  
* Hnefatafl game (it's like Viking chess/checkers)?  
* and a ton of smaller projects/Jupyter notebooks
