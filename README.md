# #60daysofudacity 
My notes are here:  https://terbets.id.lv

## Day 16:
* Intro to Pytorch, Udacity course, went over lessons 2 - 3. (https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188)
* Slack App challenge. Built a web search for the AMA dataset. Now I want to use ML to provide a better search. Current web search can be seen here: https://ingus-t.github.io/SPAI-AMA-search/  

## Day 15:
* Slack App challenge - working on my app that will look up questions/answers in AMA database. Registered it on the test workspace.
Parsed AMA transcript file into an array of questions and answers (1024 in total). Now I have to figure out how to compare new questions vs questions already asked.
* Quickly going over (skimming through) some papers on NN architectures for question answering:
  * Attention-over-Attention Neural Networks for Reading Comprehension, https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04423
  * R-NET, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/r-net.pdf
  * ReasoNet, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05284.pdf

## Day 14:
* Interview for the *Interview_Club* challenge, with @Dumeer
* Signed up for the Slack App challenge, started working on my slack app `SPAI chat bot`. Goal is to aggregate questions from AMA sessions and provide a machine learning aided search. First I need to figure how to parse the questions and answers from the transcript file.
* Going over lesson 6 and PATE analysis again.

## Day 13:
* Read a paper:  Plausible Deniability for Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis by Vincent Bindschaedler, Reza Shokri, Carl A. Gunter
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07975](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07975)

## Day 12:
* Finished Lesson 8, started lesson 9
* Read a paper: Generative adversarial networks by Ian J. Goodfellow (I´m trying to read ML classics now )
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)

## Day 11:
* Read a paper: Differentially Private Federated Learning - A Client Level Perspective, by Robin C. Geyer, Tassilo Klein, Moin Nabi
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07557](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07557)

## Day 10:
* Virtual meeting. It was our first one, so some exercises from the course were talked about, and some project ideas.
@Shivam Raisharma @nabhanpv @Alejandro Galindo @Dharmendra Choudhary @Alejandro Galindo @Tyler Yang @Ricardo Pretelt @Ingus Terbets @Droid @Sadmi Bouhafs @souvikb1812 @Abhishek Tandon
* Lessons 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 (again. Repetition is good)
* Read a paper: Robust De-anonymization of Large Sparse Datasets, Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov, 2008 (The Netflix privacy leak paper)
[https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610105.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610105.pdf)

## Day 9:
* Lessons 8.3, 8.4, 8.5

## Day 8:

## Day 6:
* Finished lesson 7, second half of it;
Tagging people whose names start with Z, @Zaki Indra Sukma @Akramz @Zhilin Wang !

## Day 5:
* Lesson 7, the first half of it
* Started reading "The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy" by Cynthia Dwork, Aaron Roth (sections 1-2)
Tagging people whose name starts with w, you're invited to the #60daysofudacity initiative!
@Wadinga Leonard N. @Nícolas Pauli @Ahmad Waly

## Day 4:
* Finished lessons 5 and 6.

## Day 3:
* Reading "Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach". I remembered about this book because someone on Slack mentioned it, so I decided to read it again 

## Day 2:
* Lessons 5.6, 5.7

## Day 1:
* Took the pledge
* Went over lesson 4 videos (repetition is good)
* Started going over lesson 5 videos
* Not related to this course but - I found a very good tool for organizing my notes (CherryTree)
