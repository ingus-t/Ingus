# #60daysofudacity

## Day 21
* Book reading club, virtual meeting #3, about the paper ¨Generative adversarial nets¨ by Ian J. Goodfellow. Thanks @Dharmendra Choudhary and @Nicolas Araque for organizing! :slightly_smiling_face:
And everyone else participating! Now we need to build some GANs :slightly_smiling_face: @Droid @Sarah Majors @Sayed Maheen Basheer  @Abhishek Tandon  @Sankalp Dayal @Nirupama Singh
* 100 page ML book by Andriy Burkov, read section  5 - basic practice (feature engineering, one-hot encoding, binning, confusion matrix etc.)
* Work on my Slack App project, built a node.js web service, now I need to connect it to my Slack app :slightly_smiling_face:. And first stage of this project will be complete.

## Day 20
* Study group Novice-AI virtual meeting #1. Thank you @Stark for organizing, and @ayivima for the Python questions on the channel :) And everyone who attended, it was nice to meet you :)
@Michael Sheinman @Eman @cibaca @Shudipto Trafder @Rosa Paccotacya @Agata [OR, USA] @Sayed Maheen Basheer @Olivia  @Aarthi Alagammai  @Poornima Venkatraman @SANMITRA 
* _The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book_ by Andriy Burkov, sections: 3 - Fundamental algorithms, 4 - Anatomy of a learning algorithm. This book is really like a vocabulary for ML. Not sure who recommended this to me, but - thank you! :)
* Work on my slack app (AMA question search), I decided to switch to a node.js web service.
@Aisha Javed thanks for the encouragement! :)

## Day 19
* AMA with Robert Wagner from OpenMined
* Started doing course _Intro to Data Analysis_, did 1/3 of lesson 1. Using Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib instead of the suggested methods makes it a bit more challenging. And repetition is good :slightly_smiling_face:
* 100 page ML book by Andriy Burkov, read sections: 1 - Introduction, 2 - Notation and definitions (scalars, vectors, derivatives, gradients etc.)

## Day 18
* Experimenting with a GAN example from here https://github.com/chainer/chainer/tree/master/examples/dcgan
* Completed book_club quiz #2 (PyTorch)
* Went over my notes from lessons 2 - 4 from PyTorch course again. I've realized I should spend more time on repetition. Planning to focus more on maths/statistics in the upcoming days.
My notes about #60daysofudacity are here:  https://terbets.id.lv

## Day 17
* Papers club quiz #2, 86.67% score
* Novice-AI quiz #1
* Reading about GANs and CNNs.

## Day 16
* Intro to Pytorch, Udacity course, went over lessons 2 - 3. (https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188)
* Slack App challenge. Built a web search for the AMA dataset. Now I want to use ML to provide a better search. Current web search can be seen here: https://ingus-t.github.io/SPAI-AMA-search/  

## Day 15
* Slack App challenge - working on my app that will look up questions/answers in AMA database. Registered it on the test workspace.
Parsed AMA transcript file into an array of questions and answers (1024 in total). Now I have to figure out how to compare new questions vs questions already asked.
* Quickly going over (skimming through) some papers on NN architectures for question answering:
  * Attention-over-Attention Neural Networks for Reading Comprehension, https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04423
  * R-NET, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/r-net.pdf
  * ReasoNet, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05284.pdf

## Day 14
* Interview for the *Interview_Club* challenge, with @Dumeer
* Signed up for the Slack App challenge, started working on my slack app `SPAI chat bot`. Goal is to aggregate questions from AMA sessions and provide a machine learning aided search. First I need to figure how to parse the questions and answers from the transcript file.
* Going over lesson 6 and PATE analysis again.

## Day 13
* Read a paper:  Plausible Deniability for Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis by Vincent Bindschaedler, Reza Shokri, Carl A. Gunter
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07975](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07975)

## Day 12
* Finished Lesson 8, started lesson 9
* Read a paper: Generative adversarial networks by Ian J. Goodfellow (I´m trying to read ML classics now )
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)

## Day 11
* Read a paper: Differentially Private Federated Learning - A Client Level Perspective, by Robin C. Geyer, Tassilo Klein, Moin Nabi
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07557](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07557)

## Day 10
* Virtual meeting. It was our first one, so some exercises from the course were talked about, and some project ideas.
@Shivam Raisharma @nabhanpv @Alejandro Galindo @Dharmendra Choudhary @Alejandro Galindo @Tyler Yang @Ricardo Pretelt @Ingus Terbets @Droid @Sadmi Bouhafs @souvikb1812 @Abhishek Tandon
* Lessons 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 (again. Repetition is good)
* Read a paper: Robust De-anonymization of Large Sparse Datasets, Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov, 2008 (The Netflix privacy leak paper)
[https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610105.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610105.pdf)
