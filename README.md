## Day 20
* Study group Novice-AI virtual meeting #1. Thank you @Stark for organizing, and @ayivima for the Python questions on the channel :) And everyone who attended, it was nice to meet you :)
@Michael Sheinman @Eman @cibaca @Shudipto Trafder @Rosa Paccotacya @Agata [OR, USA] @Sayed Maheen Basheer @Olivia  @Aarthi Alagammai  @Poornima Venkatraman @SANMITRA 
* _The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book_ by Andriy Burkov, sections: 3 - Fundamental algorithms, 4 - Anatomy of a learning algorithm. This book is really like a vocabulary for ML. Not sure who recommended this to me, but - thank you! :)
* Work on my slack app (AMA question search), I decided to switch to a node.js web service.
@Aisha Javed thanks for the encouragement! :)

## Day 19
* AMA with Robert Wagner from OpenMined
* Started doing course _Intro to Data Analysis_, did 1/3 of lesson 1. Using Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib instead of the suggested methods makes it a bit more challenging. And repetition is good :slightly_smiling_face:
* 100 page ML book by Andriy Burkov, read sections: 1 - Introduction, 2 - Notation and definitions (scalars, vectors, derivatives, gradients etc.)

## Day 18
* Experimenting with a GAN example from here [https://github.com/chainer/chainer/tree/master/examples/dcgan](https://github.com/chainer/chainer/tree/master/examples/dcgan)
* Completed book_club quiz #2 (PyTorch)
* Went over my notes from lessons 2 - 4 from PyTorch course again. I've realized I should spend more time on repetition. Planning to focus more on maths/statistics in the upcoming days.

## Day 17
* Papers club quiz #2, 86.67% score
* Novice-AI quiz #1
* Reading about GANs and CNNs.

## Day 16
* Intro to Pytorch, Udacity course, went over lessons 2 - 3. [https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188)
* Slack App challenge. Built a web search for the AMA dataset. Now I want to use ML to provide a better search. Current web search can be seen here: [https://ingus-t.github.io/SPAI-AMA-search/](https://ingus-t.github.io/SPAI-AMA-search/)

## Day 15
* Slack App challenge - working on my app that will look up questions/answers in AMA database. Registered it on the test workspace.
Parsed AMA transcript file into an array of questions and answers (1024 in total). Now I have to figure out how to compare new questions vs questions already asked.
* Quickly going over (skimming through) some papers on NN architectures for question answering:
  * Attention-over-Attention Neural Networks for Reading Comprehension, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04423](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04423)

  * ReasoNet, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05284.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05284.pdf)

## Day 14
* Interview for the *Interview_Club* challenge, with @Dumeer
* Signed up for the Slack App challenge, started working on my slack app `SPAI chat bot`. Goal is to aggregate questions from AMA sessions and provide a machine learning aided search. First I need to figure how to parse the questions and answers from the transcript file.
* Going over lesson 6 and PATE analysis again.
